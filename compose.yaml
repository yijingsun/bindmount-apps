# Here the instructions define your application as two services called "todo-app" and “todo-database”
# The service “todo-app” is built from the Dockerfile in the /app directory,
# and the service “todo-database” uses the official MongoDB image 
# from Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo. 
# You can add other services your application may depend on here.

services:
  todo-app:
    build:
      context: ./app
    links:
      - todo-database
    volumes: 
      # 将本地 app 目录挂载到容器的 /usr/src/app 目录
      # 这样你对本地代码的修改会立即反映在容器中
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
      - /usr/src/app/node_modules
    ports:
      - 3001:3001

  todo-database:
    image: mongo:6
    command: mongod --port 27018
